This repository contains code developed as part of my bachelor thesis project, "History Quest," a serious game designed to teach schoolchildren about ancient Egyptian history.

The code integrates with the Unity engine to power various game mechanics and features. It works alongside other project components developed within Unity, forming the foundation for an engaging and educational experience.

"History Quest" aims to combine fun gameplay with historical learning, offering an interactive tool for both education and entertainment.
